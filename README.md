# Orges Gurakuqi — C++ Project

A small C++ demo project that models `Person`, `Student` and `Teacher` classes and provides
**Prerequisites:**
- `g++` (MinGW / MSYS2 / TDM-GCC) installed and available on `PATH` (or use WSL).

# Student & Teacher Management System

A C++ application for managing student and teacher information with dynamic grade and class tracking.

## Features

- **Student Management**: Track student information including name, surname, age, faculty, class, and grades
- **Teacher Management**: Manage teacher details including name, surname, age, title, number of classes, and student list
- **Dynamic Data Entry**: Input and validate student/teacher data at runtime
- **Grade Tracking**: Record and display student grades
- **German Grading System**: Teachers use the German grading scale (1-6, where 1 is best and grades 1-4 are approved)

3. Press `F5` to run with debugger
4. Or use Task → Run Task → "Build Project (g++)"

### Using Command Line

```bash
cd "C:\orges programming\orges c++"

# Build
g++ -g -I./include -o ./bin/Debug/project.exe \
    src/main.cpp src/person.cpp src/student.cpp src/teacher.cpp

# Run
./bin/Debug/project.exe
```

## Class Hierarchy

```
Person (Base Class)
├── Student
└── Teacher
```

## Class Descriptions

### Person
Base class for both Student and Teacher
- Properties: `name`, `surname`, `age`
- Methods: getters and setters for all properties

### Student : public Person
Extends Person class with academic information
- Additional Properties: `faculty`, `class`, `grades` (vector)
- Methods: 
  - `setFaculty()` / `getFaculty()`
  - `setCls()` / `getCls()`
  - `pushData()` - Input student grades
  - `outputData()` - Display grade vector

### Teacher : public Person
Extends Person class with professional information
- Additional Properties: `title`, `nrOfClasses`, `students` (vector)
- Methods:
  - `setTitle()` / `getTitle()`
  - `setNrOfClasses()` / `getNrOfClasses()`
  - `insertStudents()` - Add students with German grade validation (1-6 scale, approval threshold: grades 1-4)
  - `outputStudents()` - Display approved students list

## Usage Example

```
